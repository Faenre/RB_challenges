# RB Challenges

Launch School Ruby challenges.

> These exercises can range in effort from 30 minutes to several hours and will require that you've taken courses RB101-RB130. You might be able to tackle some of them after course RB120, but we suggest that you finish RB130 before giving these a try. These exercises also serve as a wonderful refresher for those who have moved beyond course RB130 and need something to keep sharp.
